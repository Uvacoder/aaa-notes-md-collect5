git remote prune origin # prunes tracking branches not on the remote
git branch â€”merged # lists branches that have been merged into the current branch
git branch -d ...
```

## Shallow clone repository (single branch with truncated history)

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://path/to/repo/foo.git -b bar
```
